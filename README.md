<h2 id="#introduction">Introduction👋</h2>

> Schools are supposed to be a place where quality education, integration, and safety are provided, in the best of circumstances, they will be a place that leads everyone to a promising future. However, schools are no longer truly safe, as they can be a place of bullying, sexual harassment, physical punishment, verbal abuse, and other forms of violence, including school shootings.

ProtectED is a project aimed at `addressing` the issue of school violence, `minimizing` all forms of violence, and `ensuring` the safety of students both physically and mentally.
